SOFA (Scala Objects For Ant01n3)
================================

This is a quite simple utility library I develop when I have spare time. It is by no mean complete correct, usable as a library, it could change at any time and is probably quite buggy.

Actually you will find in it a math library mostly intended to be used for computer graphics, and an object-oriented OpenGL layer above Jogl.

The code is provided under the LGPL V3.
