SOFA (Scala Objects For Ant01n3)
================================

This is a quite simple utility library I develop when I have spare time. It is by no mean complete, correct, usable as a library, it could change at any time and is probably quite buggy.

Actually you will find in it a math library mostly intended to be used for computer graphics, and an object-oriented OpenGL layer above Jogl and the Android OpenGL API. The goal is to be usable both on the desktop and on Android. It contains a lot of experimentation, and classes are not provided as finished tools, only as test of what can be done, and questions on how it can be done best with Scala.

The code is provided under the LGPL V3.
